The Odin Project: Recipes
The current project will allow me to practice the HTML knowledge that I have acquired during my The Odin Project curriculum. I will build a basic recipe website.
To start with, I created a repository in GitHub, copied it to my local machine and committed to changes. I built a basic recipe website by creating an index file. 
The website will consist of a main index page with links to recipes. I will demonstrate Visual Studio Code skills, Command Line Interface skills, git and GitHub skills, and HTML skills.
